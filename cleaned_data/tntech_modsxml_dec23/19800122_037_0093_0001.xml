   <abstract>The heating plant was erected in 1929. It was equipped with four high-pressure boilers, a concrete stack 120 feet high, and steam lines housed in concrete tunnels. In 1944, the plant was modernized with the installation of new boilers, stokers, and a railway siding with a dumping trestle. In 1948, a new wing was added which doubled the total capacity. In 1956, a new front was added to the entire building, providing additional classroom and laboratory space. In 1949 an additional wing was added on the north side of the Heating Plant making facilities available for a modern laboratory in Mechanical Engineering, a classroom, and offices.</abstract>
