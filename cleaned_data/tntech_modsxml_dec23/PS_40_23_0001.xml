      <title>Old University Center (Library Annex) Repairs to front of building</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Oakley Hall is on the southeast corner of the main quad. It was originally called “South Hall” or the Home Economics building and was built in 1931. The Home Economics department was on the second floor and had laboratories for food and dietetics laboratories, clothing, art, home nursing, child care, and private kitchens and dining rooms. It originally had a dining hall, cafeteria, and waiting room area but the building later operated as the Tech Union Building or University Center and received a remodel in 1954 including the addition of two new wings. The building now included a cafeteria and dining hall, a student bookstore, recreation rooms, a post office, and offices for student activities and publications such as The Oracle. The post office had lock-boxes and general delivery facilities for the student body. The Roaden University Center became the new University Center in 1970-71971 and the old Tech Union Building became the Library Annex, a space used to hold the overflow of library materials from the Jere Whitson Memorial Library. The Library Annex housed periodicals, government documents, and reserve reading materials. After building the Volpe Library, Oakley Hall continued to serve the Home Economics department, which became Human Ecology. The building was named Oakley Hall on September 25, 2015 after Millard V. Oakley and J. J. Oakley and as of 2023, contained the departments of Human Ecology and the MacIndoe Historic Costume Collection.</abstract>
