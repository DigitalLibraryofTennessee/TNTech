   <abstract>Smith Lodge (or men's lodge) was a recreation center in the middle of Smith Quadrangle built by the maintenance department in 1968-1969. It was partially paid for with the student maintenance fee ($22 in 1968) and took 18 months to construct. It was three stories including the basement. The lodge featured a game room with pool and ping pong, laundry room, a lounge with six living room suites, a television room, a snack room with vending machines, and an AM-FM stereo intercom system. It was a place where residents could entertain guests including "women students, during designated hours."</abstract>
