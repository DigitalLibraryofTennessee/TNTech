      <title>Breakfast at President's home for department heads (Walton House)</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Tennessee Tech built the first president’s home in 1927 under the tenure of President Quintin Miller Smith (1920-1938). Tech expanded and remodeled the home in 1942 under Everett Derryberry. Later, the home was located on ground that was needed for a women’s dormitory expansion so Tech tore it down. Tech built the second president’s home, Walton House, during Derryberry’s presidency. Walton House is named after Old Walton Road, which was the historical route from Nashville to Washington DC that passed the campus. The current home is designed in the Georgian style shared with the rest of the campus. Contractors did not build Walton House, but rather it was built by Tech Maintenance under the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Frank Moss and Beecher Eller. Completed in 1965, it took over four years to complete construction because campus maintenance took precedence.</abstract>
