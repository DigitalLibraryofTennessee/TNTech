   <abstract>Tucker Stadium, the home venue for the Tennessee Tech football program since the Golden Eagles moved into the facility in 1966. The venue is named in tribute to former Golden Eagle coach Wilburn Tucker. The stadium features a two-level press box on each side, with the West Box hosting the working press and the East Box hosting the president and his guests. As of 2023, the facility had a capacity of 16,500. The facility was officially dedicated as Tucker Stadium at Homecoming ceremonies on Oct. 18, 1980, in honor of former coach Wilburn Tucker, who served on the Golden Eagle staff for 21 years. The playing field itself retained its designation as Overall Field, named for coach P.V. Overall, who was head coach at Tech for 26 years. Both men are in the Tech Sports Hall of Fame and the OVC Hall of Fame. When the stadium was built in 1966, it featured a press box on the West side for the working press. The first synthetic turf was laid in 1970 and was replaced in 1980. https://www.ttusports.com/inside_athletics/Facilities_Photos/Tucker_Stadium_Page The field is covered with Poly-Turf and the track with Uni-Turf and the stadium only seated 22,000 at the time of installation.</abstract>
