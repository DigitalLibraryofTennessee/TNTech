      <title>Business Building</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Johnson Hall was completed in 1970 as the business administration building. It was named in honor of the Dean of the College of Business Administration, Dr. Louis Johnson, Jr. The space was 69,000 feet with classrooms, a lounge, data processing, and closed-circuit televisions. The cost for completion was $1,250,000. The building initially housed business administration, and a little later, speech and theater. As of the 2020s, Johnson Hall had four academic units including Accounting and Business Law; Economics, Finance, and Marketing; Decision Sciences and Management; and Graduate Studies. There were two Centers of Excellence and a Student Success Center. It also had a professional clothes closet, the Heidtke Training Room, and the Don Ervin Auditorium, which seated 150 people.</abstract>
