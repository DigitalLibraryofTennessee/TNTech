      <title>Turf construction and stadium</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Tucker Stadium was built in 1966 and became the home venue for Tennessee Tech football programâ€™s Golden Eagles the same year. It was originally a 12,000-seat stadium of concrete and steel construction on the northwest quadrant of the campus. It had a six-lane, all-weather track. The field was covered with Poly-Turf and the track with Uni-Turf. The stadium featured a two-level press box on each side, with the West Box hosting the working press and the East Box hosting the president and his guests. The first synthetic turf was laid in 1970 and was replaced in 1980. The venue was named in tribute to former Golden Eagle coach Wilburn Tucker at the Homecoming ceremonies on October 19, 1980. As of 2023, the facility had a capacity of 16,500, expanded in the 1971 season. The playing field was named Overall Field after coach P.V. Overall, who was head coach at Tech for 26 years. Both men are in the Tech Sports Hall of Fame and the OVC Hall of Fame. https://www.ttusports.com/inside_athletics/Facilities_Photos/Tucker_Stadium_Page</abstract>
