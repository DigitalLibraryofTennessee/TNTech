      <title>Interview with Damon Prince</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Audio recording of an interview of Damon Prince by Joshua Egwuatu conducted over Zoom for the Black Cultural Center Oral History Project. The recording duration is 1 hour, 5 minutes, 18 seconds. Prince attended Tennessee Tech University off and on from 1992 to 2014. Prince discusses his background in a military family, why he decided to attend Tennessee Tech, how Cookeville was different from other places he lived, how changes to high school academic requirements made him ineligible to play football at Tech, his interest in music and career in music, what it was like being a minority student at Tennessee Tech, university employees and friends that pushed and helped him graduate, how he got involved with the Leona Lusk Officer Black Cultural Center (BCC), how students used the Black Cultural Center, his career in human resources, and his work for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Princes gives advice to students and Egwuatu. Egwuatu compares his experiences with the BCC and college with Prince's experiences.
