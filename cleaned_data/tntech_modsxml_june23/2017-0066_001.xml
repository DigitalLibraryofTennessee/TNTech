      <title>Putnam County Music Festival scrapbook</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract> In 1941, Putnam County held a county-wide musical festival written and staged by Putnam County elementary schools called "Music America." Assistance was provided by Putnam and White County high schools, the Baxter Parent-Teacher Association, and Tennessee Polytechnic Institute. The event was held in the gymnasium on Tennessee Technological University’s campus. The songs and acting in the festival traced events throughout American history, including depictions of traditional Thanksgiving themes, colonial life, frontier life, and World War I. The musical acts also depict plantation life and slavery. The event was an observance of American Education Week. The collection contains newspaper articles, scripts, committee lists, song lists, song lyrics, sheet music, instructions for the event, and correspondence including regrets. Sheet music include "The Man on the Flying Trapeze," "Sandy Land: American Folk Song," "Daisy Bell," "The Liberty Song," "My Buddy," "Old Hundredth," "Pop Goes the Weasel," "Springfield Mountain (Appalachian Mountain ballad)," and "A Paper of Pins." There was also a Prayer for Thanksgiving.</abstract>
