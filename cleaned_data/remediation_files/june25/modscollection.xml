<titleInfo><title>Backdoor Playhouse Flyers, 1960-1969</title></titleInfo>
<abstract>This collection features playbills dating back to before Techs first season in 1955-1956. During this time, theatrical productions were primarily held in the Library Auditorium, located is what is now known as the Jere Whitson Building. The Tech Players, officially recognized as Techs Drama Club, staged their first production here. The Backdoor Playhouse was officially named during the 1970-1971 school year. The collection includes programs from the Tech Players, Alpha Psi Omega, and other theater events at the Backdoor Playhouse. It also features programs from productions in the Upper Cumberland region and those attended by Playhouse staff. The programs are organized by decade, with separate folders for National Shakespeare Company programs and Cookeville Arts Council Children's Theatre programs. An "unsorted" folder contains photographs, ticket stubs, theater and opera programs (including those by the Wesley Foundation and Black Student Organization), Tech Players award banquet records, and schedules. Note: Records from 1950s-1970s experienced water damage prior to arriving at the archives, so materials displayed exhibit mold and rust damage.</abstract>

<titleInfo><title>National Shakespeare Company Flyers</title></titleInfo>
<abstract>This collection features playbills dating back to before Techs first season in 1955-1956. During this time, theatrical productions were primarily held in the Library Auditorium, located is what is now known as the Jere Whitson Building. The Tech Players, officially recognized as Techs Drama Club, staged their first production here. The Backdoor Playhouse was officially named during the 1970-1971 school year. The collection includes programs from the Tech Players, Alpha Psi Omega, and other theater events at the Backdoor Playhouse. It also features programs from productions in the Upper Cumberland region and those attended by Playhouse staff. The programs are organized by decade, with separate folders for National Shakespeare Company programs and Cookeville Arts Council Children's Theatre programs. An "unsorted" folder contains photographs, ticket stubs, theater and opera programs (including those by the Wesley Foundation and Black Student Organization), Tech Players award banquet records, and schedules. Note: Records from 1950s-1970s experienced water damage prior to arriving at the archives, so materials displayed exhibit mold and rust damage.</abstract>

Other images show the construction of a bridge on the Cumberland River in Lebanon. The collection also includes photographs of camp life during the construction process, featuring the workers involved. Additionally, the album contains photos taken by Whitfield of various other bridges, including those in Gainesboro, Lebanon, Sparta, Martin, Elkton, Halls, and Historic Double Bridges. While many photos focus on the bridge construction, several capture the workers and surrounding areas.</abstract>

Additionally, the album contains photos taken by Whitfield of various other bridges, including those in Gainesboro, Lebanon, Sparta, Martin, Elkton, Halls, and Historic Double Bridges.

Additionally, the album contains photos taken by Whitfield of various other bridges, including those in Gainesboro, Lebanon, Sparta, Martin, Elkton, Halls, and Historic Double Bridges.

Star of radio, stage and screen, and favorite cowboy artist of millions of listeners over WOAI (BC) and WOAI-TV. Be sure to see him in niversal-International's Western Featurettes, recent releases being "Echo Ranch" and "Hidden Valley Days". Dave's a successful song writer, too, with scores of top-favorite cowboy and hill-Billy songs now being released on MGM Records. If you ask "Red River Dave" about guitars he'll tell you, straight off that with him it's Gretsch Synchromatic exclusively, and has been for years. As for strings, Dave says you can't beat Gretsch La Tosca Brand for tone and durability.</abstract>

<titleInfo><title>People with Old Salem Methodist Church sign</title></titleInfo>
<abstract>Unidentified group of people with Old Salem Methodist Church sign that reads: Old Salem Methodist Church - South, one mile - Isaac Buck organized this church, one of the oldest in the County, in 1820.  Before the Civil War the site was a famous camp meeting ground.  When Putnam County was permanently established in 1854, courts met in the old log church, and the militia mustered outside.  The present structure was built in 1925.</abstract>

<titleInfo><title>2025-0001 Dr. Tony Baker Graphic Novel Class comics</title></titleInfo>
<abstract>Students taking Dr. Tony Baker's Fall 2024 Graphic Novel class (ENGL 4650) created Archive Comics Projects by researching primary source documents in Tech's Archives and Special Collections. Students wrote comic scripts and used their artistic skills to compose fiction and nonfiction comics. The student cartoonists used a variety of visual styles to tell a wide range of local, archived-based stories. These stories were digitized and shared in an online exhibit. The archives only holds the digital versions. 

In previous Graphic Novel classes, students worked with Kim Winkle's Art 2320 students to illustrate comics. Their work is in published books at the University Archives under Collab-O-Comix.</abstract>

<titleInfo><title>Tech Times</title></titleInfo>
<abstract>Tech Times is a newsletter that shares information about events and happenings on the Tennessee Tech campus. The first edition was published in print during the fall 1963 term. It continued in print until January 2003, when it transformed into an email newsletter. The email editions cater to faculty and staff, with a dedicated student edition introduced later. As of 2025, these newsletters are also available online at Tech Times Blog: https://blogs.tntech.edu/techtimes/ Note: There is a significant gap in the Tech Times collection from the years 2007 to 2017. During this period, the newsletter underwent various transitions and updates, which resulted in incomplete archival records.</abstract>
